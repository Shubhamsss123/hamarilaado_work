I acknowledge that I am participating in the activity outlined by this virtual event by my own free will and at my own personal risk. I agree to follow all pedestrian safety ordinances including running on a sidewalk where available and not in the road.

I further understand and agree that I am financially responsible for any medical treatment that I may receive before, during or after the Race, and I hereby release organizers, and its agents, directors, officers, volunteers, and employees from any liability, financial or otherwise, for any such medical treatment that I may receive.</p>
            <p>- I grant consent that any and all photographed and/or filmed material can be published, used and emitted publicly and otherwise used for the purpose of promotional activities.</p>
            <p>- Having read and understand agree to the contents of the above release and waiver, I affirm that I am of legal age (or a parent or adult guardian for all children under 18 years) to sign this document and I am signing it voluntarily and without inducement.</p>
